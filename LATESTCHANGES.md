### Added
- We've added support for LuaJIT imaginary numbers which also resulted in the following being added:
	- `SyntaxFactory.Literal(Complex value)`;
	- `SyntaxFactory.Literal(string text, Complex value)`;
	- `SyntaxFactory.Literal(SyntaxTriviaList leading, string text, Complex value, SyntaxTriviaList trailing)`;
	- `ObjectDisplay.FormatLiteral(Complex value, ObjectDisplayOptions options, CultureInfo? cultureInfo = null)`.
